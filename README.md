# IntelliMap360-Multi-Agent-System-for-Building-Smart-Customer-Profiles
📌 Project Overview
This project presents a multi-agent framework that automates the design and recommendation of Customer 360 data products for retail banking customers. It aims to streamline the manual and complex process of interpreting business use cases, defining schema, identifying source attributes, creating mappings, and certifying the data product — all through coordinated agents and an interactive dashboard.

🧩 Problem Statement
Retail banks face challenges in creating unified Customer 360 views due to siloed systems, fragmented attributes, and lack of automation in data product design. This leads to inefficient data integration, inconsistent outputs, and high manual effort.

✅ Proposed Solution
We designed a modular multi-agent system where each agent performs a specialized function:

Use Case Agent – Extracts key requirements from a business use case.

Schema Agent – Recommends the target data product schema.

Source Mapping Agent – Identifies source attributes and systems.

Mapping Agent – Generates transformation logic and source-to-target mapping.

Ingress/Egress Agent – Designs data flow mechanisms.

Certification Agent – Validates the data product against governance standards.

All agents interact in sequence and are integrated into a Streamlit dashboard for real-time execution, visualization, and collaboration.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python – Core development language

Streamlit – Interactive dashboard interface

Pandas – Data processing and transformation

OpenAI / LLMs (Optional) – For interpreting natural language use cases

LangChain (Optional) – Agent orchestration

CSV / JSON – Data storage for schema and mappings

GitHub – Version control and collaboration

VS Code / Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
